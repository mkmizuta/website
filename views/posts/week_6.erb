<h1>Accessibility!</h1>
<p>
  A website has to be accessible to be used.  This week, thanks to guest lecturer <a href="http://dpersing.com/">Devon Persing</a>, we learned the what, why and how.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The what</strong>
  Web accessibility means “making online content usable for people with physical, cognitive and learning disabilities that affect how they interact with the web.”
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The why</strong>
  If the site isn’t accessible, it won’t be used.  It’s important to consider how accessible your site is for those with disabilities, including vision, hearing, motor skills (can’t use a mouse) and cognitive.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The how</strong>
  There are three levels of compliance: Level A (least strict) to Level AAA (most strict).  Most companies aim for Level AA. 

  To determine one’s compliance level, web content must POUR:

  <ol>
    <li>Perceivable (can users access the content)</li>
    <li>Operable (can site users use interactive elements)</li>
    <li>Understandable (can users understand and navigate the site</li>
    <li>Robust (can users access the site on both the device and technology of their choosing)</li>
  </ol>

  Devon had three tips to make your site accessible:

  <ol>
    <li>Use HTML, CSS and Javascript correctly.</li>
    <li>Organize your site content logically, so that people and machines can understand it.</li>  
    <li>When appropriate, supplement valid HTML with extra attributes that provide more information to screen readers.</li>
  </ol>

  There are various tools available to test a website’s accessibility.

  First, you’ll need to test your HTML. 
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://html5.validator.nu/">Validator.nu (X)HTML5 Validator</a></li>
  </ul>

  Second, test it against POUR.
